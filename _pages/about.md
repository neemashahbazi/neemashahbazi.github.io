I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Chicago, under the guidance of [Dr. Abol Asudeh](https://asudeh.github.io/), which I consider myself incredibly fortunate for. Prior to this, I completed my MSc at the University of Texas at Dallas and earned my BSc from the University of Isfahan.

My primary research focus revolves around Algorithmic Fairness and Responsible AI with a strong emphasis on data-centric approaches. In this domain, I am dedicated to designing algorithms that are efficient, effective, and scalable throughout the entire data analysis pipeline. Additionally, I have a keen interest in various aspects of data management, including Data Integration and Query Processing, and I am always eager to explore new and intriguing areas of research.

I am always enthusiastic about the prospect of collaborating with fellow researchers, and I am more than willing to assist with any academic or research-related inquiries. Please don't hesitate to reach outâ€”I'm here to help!
