I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Chicago, under the supervision of [Dr. Abol Asudeh](https://asudeh.github.io/), which I consider myself incredibly fortunate for. Prior to this, I completed my MSc at the University of Texas at Dallas and earned my BSc from the University of Isfahan. In the Summer of 2023, I was a Research Scientist Intern at [Megagon Labs](https://megagon.ai/).

My primary research focus revolves around Algorithmic Fairness and Responsible AI with a strong emphasis on data-centric approaches. In this domain, I am dedicated to designing algorithms that are efficient, effective, and scalable throughout the entire data analysis pipeline. Additionally, I am also interested in various aspects of data management, including Data Integration and Query Processing, and I am always eager to explore new and intriguing areas of research.

I am always enthusiastic about the prospect of collaborating with fellow researchers, and I am more than willing to assist with any academic or research-related inquiries. Please don't hesitate to reach out—I'm here to help!
