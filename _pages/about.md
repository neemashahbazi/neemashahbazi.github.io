I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Chicago, under the supervision of [Dr. Abol Asudeh](https://asudeh.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas and earned my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Isfahan.

My primary research focus revolves around Algorithmic Fairness and Responsible AI with a strong emphasis on data-centric approaches. In this domain, I am dedicated to designing algorithms that are efficient, effective, and scalable throughout the entire data analysis pipeline. I also have experience in various aspects of data management research such as Data Integration, Approximate Query Processing, and Ranking. Last, but not least, I am always eager to explore new and intriguing areas of research.

I am always enthusiastic about the prospect of collaborating with fellow researchers, and I am more than willing to assist with any academic or research-related inquiries. Please don't hesitate to reach out—I'm here to help!
